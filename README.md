How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
  Ensuring that my code is working properly is very important no matter the client or type of program I am creating. There are multiple ways to ensure that it is working properly one of them being JUnit testing. By having an automated testing system to ensure that the program performs how it is supposed to is very cruical to the development process. Manual testing and review is also important along with having a peer review and test it is also a huge step that should always be taken. Constantly reviewing and testing your code ensures that is safe and functionaly the way you intend it to work and that purpsoe of the software is acheived correctly.
  
How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
  The best way to understand a users need is to communicate with them to get an understanding of what they want the program to do and how they want that program used. Keeping in contact with a client ensures their needs are met through the SDLC and that there will be little to no issues with the program once it is completed.
  
How do I approach designing software?
  I feel the best way to approach designing software is to first discuss the software with your client to get an understanding about how the software is intended to work and that it is working properly for them. As you go through the SDLC you should always maintain contact with the client to ensure that everything is included that they would like included. Another huge approach for me is to do the code in pieces instead of all at once. Doing the code in sections with proper comments allows you to verify each section is working correctly and will keep working correctly when the entire code is put together.
